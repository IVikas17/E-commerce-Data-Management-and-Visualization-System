## Data Generation

We used the Faker library to generate simulated data for the following tables:
- Products
- Customers
- Sales
- Suppliers
- Reviews
- Shipping
- Inventory
- Promotions

## Database Creation

The generated data is stored in a MySQL database. We defined the schema using SQLAlchemy and inserted the data using pandas. The tables are linked by appropriate foreign key constraints to maintain referential integrity.

## Data Dictionary

### Products
- **product_id**: Integer - Unique identifier for each product.
- **product_name**: String - Name of the product.
- **category**: String - Category of the product.
- **price**: Float - Price of the product.
- **stock_quantity**: Integer - Quantity of the product in stock.

## Power BI Dashboard

![ECommerce_page-0001](https://github.com/IVikas17/E-commerce-Data-Management-and-Visualization-System/assets/116329070/643e35bf-41bc-46b0-ace0-4eeb43d86d5c)


The Power BI dashboard includes the following KPIs and visualizations:

### KPIs
- **Top Selling Product**: Displays the product with the highest sales.
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: Calculates the average value of an order.
- **Average Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Calculates the average total revenue generated by a customer.
- **Total Sales per Product**: Displays the total sales for each product.
- **Total Quantities**: Displays the total quantities sold.

### Filters
- **Categories**: Allows users to filter the data by product categories.

### Visualizations
- **Line Chart**: Shows the daily trends of AOV, Quantity, and Total Price.
- **Line and Stacked Column Chart**: Displays categories on the x-axis with quantity as columns and quantity received as a line.
- **Pie Chart**: Shows the distribution of payment methods based on the count of sales.
- **Table**: Includes columns like product name, sum of quantities, total sales per product, AOV, average rating, and average discount percentage.

### Steps to Implement Visualizations

1. **Top Selling Product**:
    - Use a Card visualization.
    - Create a measure for Top Selling Product using DAX.
2. **Average Order Value (AOV)**:
    - Use a Card visualization.
    - Create a measure for AOV using DAX.
3. **Average Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**:
    - Use a Card visualization.
    - Create measures for Total Purchase Amount and Average CLV using DAX.
4. **Total Sales per Product**:
    - Use a Bar or Column chart.
    - Create a measure for Total Sales per Product using DAX.
5. **Total Quantities**:
    - Use a Card visualization.
    - Create a measure for Total Quantities using DAX.
6. **Line Chart for Daily Trends**:
    - Add a Line chart.
    - Set the x-axis to the date.
    - Add AOV, Quantity, and Total Price as values.
7. **Line and Stacked Column Chart**:
    - Add a Line and Stacked Column chart.
    - Set the x-axis to categories.
    - Add quantity for columns and quantity received for the line.
8. **Pie Chart for Payment Methods**:
    - Add a Pie chart.
    - Set the legend to payment method.
    - Set values to the count of sales.
9. **Table with Various Columns**:
    - Add a Table.
    - Include columns like product name, sum of quantities, total sales per product, AOV, average rating, and average discount percentage.

## Installation and Usage

### Data Generation:

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Install necessary packages:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy faker sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python
    ```
3. Run the data generation script to create the data and insert it into the MySQL database.

### Database Setup:

1. Ensure you have MySQL installed and running.
2. Create a database named Ecommerce.
3. Insert the generated data into the database.

### Power BI Dashboard:

1. Open Power BI Desktop.
2. Import data from the MySQL database.
3. Create relationships between tables as needed.
4. Implement the visualizations and KPIs as described.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the creation of a comprehensive data management and visualization system for an e-commerce brand, utilizing simulated data, a MySQL database, and Power BI for interactive dashboards. The steps provided should guide you through replicating and expanding upon this system.
